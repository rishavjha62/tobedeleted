FETCH - It is used to download changes from Github remote repository, however you will not see the changes be part of files you have in the working directory.
It allows to grab additional work done on the remote master/main branch, without needing to merge it in your working directory files.
git fetch
git fetch <remote>  <branch> --> 
git fetch origin <branch>   --> from branch. To detach from the head.
git switch to master/main --> To attach to the head again

You will still not see the new file. Run this below command.
git checkout origin/master or main --> to temporarily see stuff. 


PULL - To pull directly from the remote branch and merge them into your working directory files.
Not a best practice 
git pull --> Will download new files from remote branch
